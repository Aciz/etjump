ETJump 2.0.3 authentication system

ETJump 2.0.3 comes with a new authentication system. The old system with
usernames & passwords is no longer there. This new system will be more 
secure while also being easier to use.

Each client is authenticated using a unique identifier generated by 
boost::uuid. A hash of this unique identifier will be generated and saved
to "etguid" in the mod folder. If a client already has a guid the existing
one will be used.

Each guid is hashed with Sha1 algorithm and the hash is 40 characters in 
length.

Once the GUID is either read or generated, it goes through a test to see
if it is a legit GUID. If the guid is legit it will be hashed again and 
then sent to server using the following command:

"etguid AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

Server receives the guid, checks if it's valid and generates a Sha1-hash
from it. The hash it then saved to a data structure. Server tracks whether
user has already sent a guid. If user hasn't sent a guid commands that 
require user to have a guid will print an error message upon execution.
