# Unit testing

ETJump uses Google Test framework for unit testing. Some newer parts of the mod 
have unit tests. New features should have unit tests. More info on 
how to write and run tests can be found at `https://github.com/google/googletest`. 

# Invoking tests

Run `ctest` within the build directory. Use `ctest --help` to learn about filtering options.
