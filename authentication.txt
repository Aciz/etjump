ETJump 2.0.3 authentication system

ETJump 2.0.3 comes with a new authentication system. The old system with
usernames & passwords is no longer there. This new system will be more 
secure while also being easier to use.

Each client is authenticated using a unique identifier generated by 
boost::uuid. A hash of this unique identifier will be generated and saved
to "etguid" in the mod folder. If a client already has a guid the existing
one will be used.

Each guid is hashed with Sha1 algorithm and the hash is 40 characters in 
length.
